    "The general rule of thumb is that it is better to use **raster layers for continuous variables such as elevation, snow depth, PM2.5, or precipitation**, in order to make it easier to perform analysis based on them. **Discrete variables, on the other hand, are better represented using a vector approach**. For example while locations of airquality monitors can be represented as points (vectors), the PM2.5 concentration that they measure can be best represented using a raster. Rather than just knowing the PM2.5 value at the exact location of the airquality monitor, we would want to know the Pm2.5 value for an area or surface (for which raster is the best model)."
